# gitgpgproxy

This is an attemp to make [GitX](https://rowanj.github.io/gitx/) automatically sign your commits with GPG key.

To try, set gitgpgproxy as the "Git Executable" in GitX Preferences.

See original discussion at https://github.com/rowanj/gitx/issues/472.


UPDATE 1: if this works, a simple alias probably also does

UPDATE 2: just use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), GPG is supported out of the box
